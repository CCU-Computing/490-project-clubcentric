## Tech Stack

- Backend: Django (Python 3.x)  
- Frontend: React with TypeScript  
- Database: PostgreSQL  
- Authentication: JWT / OAuth  
- Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes  
- CI / CD: GitHub Actions  

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you’ll need:

- Python 3.10+  
- Node.js 16+ / npm or yarn  
- PostgreSQL 13+  
- `git` on your machine  
- Docker (if you wish to use containers)  

---

## Setup & Installation

Below is a local dev setup. For production, see [Deployment](#deployment).

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/mywebapp.git
cd mywebapp

# backend setup
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env to configure DATABASE_URL, etc.
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser

# frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env to set e.g. REACT_APP_API_URL

# back to project root
cd ..
docker-compose up

```

---

## Configuration

Environment variables (in `.env`):

```
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
...
```

You may also configure email server, caching, etc.

---

## Running the App (Dev Mode)

Once dependencies are installed:

```bash
# from project root
# start backend
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver

# start frontend (in separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

---

## Testing

To run backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
pytest
```

To run frontend tests:

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

---

## Deployment (Production)

We support Dockerized deployment:

```bash
docker build -t yourorg/mywebapp:latest .
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

Alternatively, deploy via Kubernetes, or host on AWS/GCP/Azure.
See `deploy/` directory for manifests and scripts.

## Architecture / Workflow

Below is an outline of the system and team workflow:

```
Client (React) ←→ REST API (Django) ←→ PostgreSQL
```

* The frontend uses HTTP + WebSocket (for real-time sync)
* The backend has modules: auth, document, collaboration, notifications
* User stories / tasks are tracked in our backlog (see `docs/user-stories.md`)
* Our development workflow is feature branching, PR review → CI → merge → deploy

You can see the detailed workflow diagram in `docs/architecture.md`.

---

## Roadmap

* Support offline editing
* Mobile app (iOS / Android)
* Role-based permissions (admin/custom roles)
* Audit logs and rollback functionality
* Plugin / extension system

---
