# Limitations/Bugs 

## Networking Page 
- The networking page is not functional. 
## Profile Page 
- When a user is not a member of any clubs, the link to join a club (go to browse clubs page/ClubSearch.jsx page) does not work and instead takes the user to a login screen FIXED
- Username, Password, Email, and Profile Picture cannot be updated from frontend (via Edit Profile page).  
## Clubs Page 
- Lacks styles like the other pages have. 
## Club Search Page 
- Can only display videos from youtube right now. 
## Calendar Page 
- Not accessible for non club members.
